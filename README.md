# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction

### Project Description:

This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecom company using machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of various features such as customer demographics, services subscribed, and payment methods. The objective is to identify the significant factors that impact customer churn and build a predictive model to forecast customer churn.

The project begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the data distribution and correlations among the features. The next step is to preprocess the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling the numerical features. Then, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and Voting Classifier are applied to the data. The models are evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Finally, the best-performing model is selected, and the feature importance is analyzed to determine the critical factors that drive customer churn. The project concludes with a summary of the results and recommendations for the telecom company to reduce customer churn.

### Libraries Used in pyhton:

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Project Outcome:

The project successfully predicts customer churn with an accuracy of 80% and identifies the critical factors such as tenure, monthly charges, contract type, and internet services that impact customer churn. The telecom company can leverage these insights to improve customer retention and reduce churn rates.
